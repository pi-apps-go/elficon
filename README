elfres - Manage application resources in ELF binaries

See the INSTALL file for general installation instructions.

* This application is a technology demonstration, at this point please DO NOT
consider this implementation to be a specification for how ELF icons will be
supported by desktop environments.  With that said, this application and the
associated "libr" resource library provide a solid mechanism for managing
application resources that you are free to use in your own applications.

See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ELFIconSpec for a detailed proposal.
